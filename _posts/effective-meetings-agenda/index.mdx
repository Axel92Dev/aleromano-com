Have you ever found yourself stuck in a meeting where you didn't know:

- What your contribution should be
- What was the objective
- What they were talking about

Or even worse, if the meeting ended up _with no results_â€¦
**This is the post you were looking for!**
Your entire productivity and success depend on fixing issues like this, too. How? Here you find some small (but **effective**) tricks.

Every meeting should have an agenda (this sentence can finish here and it would still be a _precious advice_) with 3 points: context, objective and notes.

### 1. CONTEXT

You should describe in few words the why this meeting has been set. What's the project or the initiative, what where the decisions already made e what would be the main topic.
In this way all the attendants can prepare in advance and more important know if they are relevant to the discussion.

Let's make some **good** example:

- BigCorp would like to launch a new insurance product within June. The end user contract has already been defined.
- We are adapting our systems and processess according to the new law: we have already fixed product 1 and 2, we are now focused on product 3.

And some **bad** example:

- BigCorp is one of the greatest company in Europe
- Let's talk about evolutions on our website

### 2. OBJECTIVE

This section should complete the sentence "When meeting ends, it would have been success if...".
Objectives (they may be more than one) should be simple and easily measurable.

**Good** objectives:

- Solve all the open points of the H column of the attached Excel
- Approve or deny the budget given the business case we are going to present
- Finalize the algorithm taking a decision on proposal A or B

**Not so good** objectives:

- Talk about the new product
- Understand how to handle this process
- Review the excel

When you are not able to set clear objectives it may be the sign **it's still not time to call a meeting**, you may need more time working offline gathering doubts and things to discuss.

### 3. NOTES

This is an optional section where you may signal attention points, from logistics to temporal one.

#### Other things to consider

- if you spend most of the meeting time sharing a screen it's a good signal the meeting was well prepared and you are going straight to the objectives
- except for demos or brainstormings, the more people you add to a meeting the higher the risk of inefficiency or excluding part of the audience
- a recap mail at the end of the meeting is always welcomed, it is easier if objectives were well written
- you should not fear you may be seen as disrespectful in not accepting a meeting until context and objective are not clarified from the organizer

Obviously, you need to practice.

So, what are you waiting for? Take a second look on the meetings you have already planned or go back to this post next time you need to setup one!

> Thanks for your time.
