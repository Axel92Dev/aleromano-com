## ‚è∞ Waking up (6.07 AM)

A fixed, consistent time helps your circadian rhythm and thanks to [Fitbit Smart Wake](https://www.fitbit.com/global/uk/technology/sleep) I can wake up between 5:37 and 6:07, according to my REM/Light/Deep sleep phases.

I keep the same times on weekends too.

## üö∞ Hydration (6.10 AM)

First things first: I get hydrated (with a little boost). During sleep, you naturally lose your liquids through sweating, so it's important to re-introduce them back: you'll feel more awake and without brain fog.

I used to drink just a glass of water in the cold seasons and one with some magnesium/potassium supplement during the hot ones.
Now I started mixing my water with a scoop of [SuperGreen Tonik](https://supergreentonik.com/).
I'm still evaluating if I'm getting any real improvement, a review will follow after I complete a 3-months cycle.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meditation (6.13 AM)

10 minutes are dedicated to Mindfulness Meditation.
Noting, body scan, practicing gratitude, breathing... Whatever Fitbit Premium inspires me for that particular day.
I used Headspace in the past, but now I'm focused on getting the best from a Fitbit Premium subscription.

Meditating in the morning gives me the best feeling for the entire day and helps me address my emotions during work.

## Workout (06.27 AM)

Just 10 minutes. Seriously.
If you believe 10 minutes workouts are useless... Well, you think exactly like me before I tried!
And you (and me) are wrong.
I'm not saying I'll have a super-defined body, lose weight or become a real athlete, but this is not my purpose.
10 minutes workout is enough to:

- ramp up my humor and feelings, as I feel satisfied when I finish and I don't feel guilty not having sweat at all
- relax my body from the tension I get while working with 2 monitors sitting all day
- keep my habit and help me achieve 1 hour of exercise per week

Of course, when I have more time like during holidays or weekends I try to do some other aerobic activities like walking and cycling.
I miss the time I played tennis, but I'm still struggling to find the correct timing balancing work and family.

## Breakfast (6.42 AM)

Time to reward me for being consistent: I drink a coffee with a snack, sometimes a glass of orange juice too.
I'm not yet having a super sane breakfast with fruits and vegetables, it may be something to add later in the year.

## Free time while everyone is still asleep

Now is when my routine begins to be less fixed. What I do now until I take care of my baby (7:00 AM) depends on what I need to do.
I may cook for me and wife so we have a brown box for lunch, read some newsletter, search for something, read a book, etc
It's like a 20-minute wildcard time I can choose to play on the most needed activity.

## Caring for Mattia Dante (7.07 AM)

Mattia (Dante is his second name, which is not on his documents, just on the birth certification) is my 1-year baby.
He goes to kindergarten, so I wake him up, feed him with milk, change the diaper, give a D3 vitamin supplement and wear him up so he's ready to be delivered :)
As I usually work from home, it's my wife Giulia that drives him to kindergarten.

## Free time while I'm alone (7.45 AM)

I usually get another 30-40 minutes to do other things I need or want to do, like writing this blog.

## Start working (8.25 AM)

## Going to bed (11.00 PM)

Staying consistent at bedtime is fundamental.
I'm able to get 7 hours of sleep this way, which is not as good as 8 hours but is good for me in this moment of my life.
I may have 30 minutes naps during the weekend
I try to stop using any electronic devices after 10.30 PM, the only exception being my Kindle Paperwhite.
Reading is the thing I do to relax before falling to sleep.
