## Waking up

My alarm is set to 6.07 AM
While a fixed time helps your cycardian rhythm, I use my [Fitbit Smart Wake](https://www.fitbit.com/global/uk/technology/sleep) feature to get me up between 5:37 and 6:07, considering my REM/DEEP sleep phases.
I keep the same timing on week-ends too.

## Hydration

First thing I urge to do is to get hydrated with a little boost.
I used to have just a glass of water in the cold seasons and one with some magnesium/potassium supplement during the hot ones.
Now I started mixing my water with a scoop of SuperGreen Tonik.
I'm still evaluating if I'm getting any real improvement.

## Meditation

10 minutes are dedicated to mindfulness guided meditation.
Noting, body scan, practicing gratitude, breathing... Whatever Fitbit Premium inspires me for that particular day.
I used Headspace in the past, but now I'm focused on getting the best from Fitbit Premium subscription.

Meditating in the morning gives me the best feeling for the entire day and help me address my emotions during work.

## Workout

Just 10 minutes. Seriously.
If you believe 10 minutes workout are useless... Well, you think exactly like me before I tried!
And you (and me) are wrong.
I'm not saying I'll have a super defined body, loose weight or become a real athlete, but this is not my purpose.
10 minutes workout are enough to:

- ramp up my humor and feelings, as I feel satisfied when I finish and I don't feel guilty not having sweat at all
- relax my body from the tension I get while working with 2 monitors sitting all day
- keep my habit and help me achieving 1 hour of exercies per week

Of course, when I have more time like during holidays or week-ends I try to do some other aerobic activities like walking and cycling.
I miss the time I played tennis, but I'm still struggling find correct timing balancing work and family.

## Breakfast

Time to reward me for being consistent: I drink a coffee with a snack, sometimes a glass of orange juice too.
I'm not yet having a super sane breakfast with fruits and vegetables, it may be something to add later in the year.

## Free time while everyone is still asleep

Now is when my routine begin to be less fixed. What I do now until I take care of my baby (7:00 AM) depends on what I need to do.
I may cook for me and wife so we have a brown box for lunch, read some newsletter, search something, read a book, etc etc
It's like a 20-minutes wildcard time i can choose to play on the most needed activity.
