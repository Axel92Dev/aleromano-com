## Waking up

My alarm is set to 6.00 AM
Actually I use my Fitbit Smart Alarm feature which would wake me up between 5:37 and 6:07 considering my REM/DEEP sleep phases.
Keep the same timing on week-ends too.

## Water + Supergreen Tonik

First thing I urge to do is get hydrated with a little boost.
A glass of water with a scoop of SuperGreen Tonik is what I take.

## Meditation

10 minutes are dedicated to mindfulness guided meditation.
Noting, body scan, gratitude... Whatever Fitbit premium throws at me.
I used Headspace in the past, but now I'm focused on getting the best from Fitbit Premium subscription.

Meditating in the morning gives me the best feeling for the entire day and help me address my emotions during work.
