## How to practice meditation

It's easy to start doing mindfulness meditation. All you have to do is sit down, close your eyes, and focus on the breath as it passes through your nostrils. You don't need any special tools or props—you can use a chair if you want, but it isn't necessary.
You can even practice it while walking or eating.

If you're new to meditation, this might be intimidating at first: that's why I suggest you start with **guided** meditation using [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/)

## Code can't be clean if your mind is not

Don't think of mindfulness as a state of mind. It's about being aware of what is happening in your mind and body. If you're not mindful, then you might be distracted by external factors and we all know how a long-lasting focus is fundamental when writing code.

Having clear intentions on what to do will help you write code that communicates better its **intentions**.
Living in the present will prevent you from engineering unnecessary upfront abstractions.

Writing a test list before you start writing code is another technique that allows you to focus on one thing at a time and then move on to the next.

## Breath slowly and fix bugs

Breathing exercises are a great way to relax and calm down. They help you focus on what you are doing, which is essential when it comes to fixing bugs.

Sometimes we get so stubborn in trying to fix a bug we forget we should slow down, pause from hitting the keyboard and re-think the problem from a different perspective.

Next time you are debugging something without result or facing an incident, try to have 10-minutes of breathing: you will create space in your mind to come up with alternative routes to solve the issue.

## Be the perfect team member by giving to others

Be generous with your time and resources when it comes to teaching people who are new at something as complex as software development—it will show that you care about their success! The more time they spend learning from you, the more likely they'll feel invested in what they're doing because they've seen firsthand how it benefits everyone involved—including YOU!

## Don't be overwhelmed by your code reviews

It's a good idea to get some practice with reviews before you have to do one. The more you know about how your code is being reviewed, the better equipped you'll be to respond in a way that reflects the actual state of things.

If possible, try running through this process with other developers who have been through similar processes before so that there are no surprises for either of you:

Don't be defensive about any mistake or issue in your codebase (even if it's an honest mistake). If someone thinks something is wrong with their understanding of what they're looking at, then let them say so and explain why they think so (and make sure they know what constitutes a good explanation).

Don't take it personally when someone has an issue with something specific in their review notes—this isn't meant as an attack on anyone else's ideas! There are many different types of problems out there; just because one person has issues with how something works doesn't mean everyone else will feel similarly aggrieved by its design decisions or implementation details.\*

## Develop a habit of mindful coding

By practicing mindfulness regularly (and especially when working), we can improve our mental health by reducing stress levels; improving focus; enhancing relationships between colleagues/teammates; increasing productivity/productivity over time by improving efficiency with tasks related!

Mindfulness is a skill that can be learned, but it’s not something you have to try. In fact, research shows that mindfulness improves your ability to think clearly and remember details. It also helps you stay focused on the task at hand—even when distractions come up or your mind wanders off into other thoughts (which happens).

Mindfulness helps you become more objective: It trains your brain to focus on tasks rather than getting distracted by external factors like smells or sounds around us. As we learned in Chapter 1 of Clean Code book: “You must keep saying yes until he says no." This means that instead of having one person make all decisions about what happens next in software development projects, there should be collaboration between everyone involved so that everyone knows how things work together as well as which actions will lead towards success with these goals in mind
