## How to practice meditation

It's easy to start doing mindfulness meditation. All you have to do is sit down, close your eyes, and focus on the breath as it passes through your nostrils. You don't need any special tools or props—you can use a chair if you want, but it isn't necessary.
You can even practice it while walking or eating.

If you're new to meditation, this might be intimidating at first: that's why I suggest you start with **guided** meditation using [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/)

## Code can't be clean if your mind is not

Don't think of mindfulness as a state of mind. It's about being aware of what is happening in your mind and body. If you're not mindful, then you might be distracted by external factors and we all know how a long-lasting focus is fundamental when writing code.

Having clear intentions on what to do will help you write code that communicates better its **intentions**.
Living in the present will prevent you from engineering unnecessary upfront abstractions.

## Breath slowly and fix bugs

Breathing exercises are a great way to relax and calm down. They help you focus on what you are doing, which is essential when it comes to fixing bugs.

## Be the perfect team member by giving to others

Give to others. Help them with their work, give advice or help them solve a problem.

Teach others. Offer a class on how to do something in programming, or teach someone how to code in your language of choice (Hint: this is the best way).

Be generous with your time and resources when it comes to teaching people who are new at something as complex as software development—it will show that you care about their success! The more time they spend learning from you, the more likely they'll feel invested in what they're doing because they've seen firsthand how it benefits everyone involved—including YOU!

Be grateful for all gifts given by others around us; whether it's from nature itself (a flower), another person's kindness towards us (a cupcake), our parents raising us up through life lessons...etc., we should always take note of these things so that next time when someone does something nice for us we'll remember exactly why those actions were so special without forgetting any details along the way."

## Don't be overwhelmed by your code reviews

It's a good idea to get some practice with reviews before you have to do one. The more you know about how your code is being reviewed, the better equipped you'll be to respond in a way that reflects the actual state of things.

If possible, try running through this process with other developers who have been through similar processes before so that there are no surprises for either of you:

Don't be defensive about any mistake or issue in your codebase (even if it's an honest mistake). If someone thinks something is wrong with their understanding of what they're looking at, then let them say so and explain why they think so (and make sure they know what constitutes a good explanation).

Don't take it personally when someone has an issue with something specific in their review notes—this isn't meant as an attack on anyone else's ideas! There are many different types of problems out there; just because one person has issues with how something works doesn't mean everyone else will feel similarly aggrieved by its design decisions or implementation details.\*

## Develop a habit of mindful coding

Mindfulness is a skill that can be learned, but it’s not something you have to try. In fact, research shows that mindfulness improves your ability to think clearly and remember details. It also helps you stay focused on the task at hand—even when distractions come up or your mind wanders off into other thoughts (which happens).

Mindfulness helps you become more objective: It trains your brain to focus on tasks rather than getting distracted by external factors like smells or sounds around us. As we learned in Chapter 1 of Clean Code book: “You must keep saying yes until he says no." This means that instead of having one person make all decisions about what happens next in software development projects, there should be collaboration between everyone involved so that everyone knows how things work together as well as which actions will lead towards success with these goals in mind

> Thanks for your time

Breathing is an especially good practice for staying calm during stressful situations because it allows us to control our emotions more easily than other activities like talking about our feelings or trying out new approaches like meditation might allow us too much control over ourselves which can lead us down paths where we don't want our emotions controlled by anything external."

Write code with a clear mind

Write code with a clear mind.

Focus on one thing at a time, and then move on to the next. This will help you avoid distractions that can cause you to lose focus or forget what you were doing in the first place.

Take breaks when needed—but don't multitask! If your phone is buzzing while working on something important (or even not so important), take some time out of your session and deal with it later. Don't worry about what other people are doing; they may have good reasons for wanting their phones off during work hours, but they're still not allowed inside our heads because it's where all our best ideas live! Don't worry about what happened yesterday either; if someone did something wrong or made an error somewhere along the way, let them deal with things themselves without involving us anymore than necessary... unless they ask nicely enough that we feel like helping them out again (in which case we'll do whatever needs done).

Be mindful while coding

It's not just about being aware of the code you're writing, but also of your surroundings. A mindful developer will be aware of their body and mind so that they can make informed decisions about what to do next. They'll be able to sense when there's a problem with their code or an error that needs fixing, which means they'll be able to fix it before anyone else sees it!

Here are some ways to practice mindfulness in coding:

Be aware of your environment when working on projects. Is everything quiet? Are people distracting or distracting others? What noise level is appropriate for this environment (elevator music vs headphones)? Is there enough space around me so that I'm not bumping into things while working at my computer station? These small details can help me stay focused on what matters most—my work—and prevent distractions from interfering with my ability to do well at it by keeping them out of sight and mind as much possible."

Mindful questions to ask yourself while coding

How can you avoid complexity?

What is the simplest solution?

How can you make things easier?

Can you simplify the problem?

Can you simplify the solution?

Can you simplify the code?

And finally, if there's any way for me to come up with a better solution than what I'm currently working on, please let me know!

How can you avoid complexity?

The best way to avoid complexity is to not write code that has any.

There are two main reasons for this:

If you're writing clean code, it's easier for others who come after you (and maybe yourself) to understand what your code does and why it does it.

Writing clean code helps keep your brain happy and healthy, which makes it easier for you to think about problems in a new way—which leads me into my second point...

Mindfulness is an ability to pay attention to what’s going on in your mind.

When you’re mindful, your mind is calm and focused. You can pay attention to the details of what’s going on inside your head so that you can make better decisions.

Mindfulness is an ability to pay attention to what’s going on in your mind. It involves being aware of how you feel, without judgment or worry about whether or not those feelings are good or bad—just simply noticing them as they come up and letting them pass away naturally. This process helps us become more aware of our thoughts and emotions, giving us a greater understanding of ourselves as well as others around us who may be experiencing similar feelings or situations themselves!

By practicing mindfulness regularly (and especially when working), we can improve our mental health by reducing stress levels; improving focus; enhancing relationships between colleagues/teammates; increasing productivity/productivity over time by improving efficiency with tasks related!

Conclusion

The most important thing to remember is that mindfulness is a skill you can learn. You don’t have to be born with it or have any special talents. In fact, many people are bad at it because they've never been taught how to practice mindfulness in their lives
